Version 1.0.0 - June29, 2022
This version of NxMiner is forked from CGMiner 2.11.3 with the following changes:
- Scrypt has been removed
- SHA256 mining has been changed to mine for Nexa although the label still says SHA256.
- The mining protocol is designed to work with Pool137's custom adaptation of the nexas mining RPCs.
- CPU mining enabled by default, GPU mining disabled. Nexa does not have GPU mining yet
- The API is not currently working but will be fixed eventually
